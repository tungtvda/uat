It does not include periods of extra time nor penalty shootouts. Occasionally, tournaments, friendlies, or other matches may have time frames different than two 45 minute halves. If Pinnacle does not announce this special playing time before the start of the game all bets will be considered void and stakes returned. If, in a game scheduled for two halves of 45 minutes each, a referee ends the game with an official result with what appears to be a time different than 2 halves of 45 minutes each, wagers will have action. If a referee declares a game abandoned for any reason, wagers will be void and stakes returned.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>For example:</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>9 May 2010: Fortuna Dusseldorf vs Hansa Rostock:<br />\r\n	The match was suspended and resumed shortly afterwards twice for crowd disturbances. The referee decided not to add extra time for the 2nd suspension and ended the match with an official result after only 87 minutes were played. In this case all wagers had action since the match was not abandoned. The referee ended the match with an official result.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>17 October 2010: FC Ashdod vs Hapoel Beer Sheva:<br />\r\n	The match was abandoned by the referee during injury time in the 93rd minute because of crowd disturbances. At a later date, Hapoel Beer Sheve was awarded a technical win by the governing Football Association. In this case, all wagers were voided since the match was abandoned. It was irrelevant that 90 minutes were completed or that match was in injury time since the referee abandoned the match. In addition, for grading purposes, awarded technical results are not taken into consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>26 June 2011: River Plate vs Belgrano:<br />\r\n	The match was ended by the referee with an official result (1:1) in the 90th minute without adding injury time because of crowd disturbances. In this case, all wagers had action because the match was not abandoned. The referee ended the match with an official result.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>If a match is suspended before full time is reached, and not completed the same day, (local time of the match site) wagers on the outcome of the match are considered void and all stakes shall be returned. If a match is suspended before full time is reached and not resumed the same day, (local time of the match site) wagers related to just the first half will have action, only if the first half has been completed. However, in the case of a suspended match not resumed the same day, (local time of the match site) most other proposition wagers not strictly related to the first half will have no action. These will include, but aren&#39;t limited to: corner kicks, offsides, players to be sent off, red/yellow cards, both teams to score, correct score, time of first goal, clean sheet, and specific players to score/not score. For further clarity, a bet on both teams to score will be void in a suspended match, even if both teams have already scored. Likewise, a wager on a player to score/not score will have no action in a suspended match, even if that player already scored. Likewise, a wager on when the first goal will be scored will have no action in a suspended match, regardless of whether a goal has been scored. Likewise all corner/offside bets will be void in a suspended match, even if the number has exceeded the posted over/under. Propositions on the team to score first, or next, will have action if there is a goal in a suspended match.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Handicap Betting:</strong>&nbsp;Soccer games may have either a&nbsp;<em>Single Handicap</em>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<em>Double Handicap</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p><em>Single Handicap:</em>&nbsp;This bet type is similar to a bet on the spread in basketball.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p><em>For example:</em></p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Arsenal<br />\r\n	Newcastle</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>-1, -125<br />\r\n	+1, +113</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>If Arsenal wins the match by two goals or more, Arsenal bettors win and Newcastle bettors lose. If the match is drawn or if Newcastle wins, Newcastle bettors win and Arsenal bettors lose. If Arsenal wins by exactly one goal, all bettors receive a refund.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p><em>Double Handicap:</em>&nbsp;This bet type splits a wager into two bets, each with the same moneyline, but at a different single handicap.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p><em>For example:</em></p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Real Madrid<br />\r\n	Barcelona</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>-1 and -1.5, -108<br />\r\n	+1 and +1.5, +100</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>A client who bets $100 on Real Madrid actually has two separate bets on Real Madrid: $50 on Real Madrid -1 at -108 and $50 on Real Madrid -1.5 at -108.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>A client who bets $50 on Barcelona actually has two separate bets on Barcelona: $25 on Barcelona +1 at +100 and $25 on Barcelona +1.5 at +100.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Overs/Unders: A match must reach full time for wagers on the total number of goals scored in the match to be valid.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Should there be a dispute over a proposition (examples include, but are not limited to: name of the first goalscorer; time of a goal) wagers will be settled and paid based on the reports of the sporting media.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Wagers on the first half of a soccer match include 45 minutes of play plus any stoppage time added by the referee at the end of the first half. If the first half is not completed, wagers shall be void and stakes returned.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Wagers on the second half of a soccer match include 45 minutes of play plus any stoppage time added by the referee at the end of the second half. Extra periods, golden goals, and shootouts are not included in second half wagering. Goals scored in the first half do not count toward the second half wager.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Example: Suppose AC Milan lead Juventus 1-0 at half time and the odds on the second half are Juventus -0.5. The -0.5 applies to the second half of play only. Therefore Juventus bettors win if Juventus scores more goals in the second half than AC Milan scores in the second half. AC Milan bettors win if the teams score an equal number of goals in the second half, or if AC Milan scores more goals in the second half than Juventus scores in the second half.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The match must reach full time for second half wagers to stand.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Bets on teams to qualify or to advance to the next round of a competition:</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Bets are paid out on the referee&rsquo;s final whistle at the match&rsquo;s natural conclusion, whether the match is decided in regular time, extra time, or in a penalty shootout. Extra time and penalty shootouts are always included for betting purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>In a one-leg match all bets have action once the match kicks off. If the referee abandons a one-leg match (for reasons including, but not limited to: crowd disturbances, unplayability of the pitch, or one team not having enough players to continue) bets will be paid based on decisions of the relevant governing body. Bets will stand while the governing body considers the circumstances of the abandonment and determines what remedy is to be taken (including, but no limited to: forfeiture, resumption of play at a later time, or a replay). If a team is disqualified before the match kicks off, all bets are void. If the rules prescribe a replay for a drawn match, all bets stand for the replay.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>In a two-leg match, all bets have action once the second leg kicks off, provided that the first leg has not been ruled a forfeit. If the first leg is ruled a forfeit, all bets on teams &lsquo;to qualify&rsquo; or &lsquo;to advance&rsquo; are void. If the second leg is abandoned, all bets remain valid and will be paid based on decisions of the relevant governing body.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Wagers made on a team winning a specific cup or trophy will have action through Extra Time and Penalty Kicks. For example, a bet made on AC Milan to win the Champions League Trophy would have action through Extra Time and Penalty Kicks and would be graded on the result after those added sessions(if they were needed to be played).</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>For proposition bets concerning total number of goals on a specific day in a specific league/competition, the exact number of matches must be played on that day and wagers will be decided based on two halves of 45 minutes each and any time the referee adds to compensate for injuries and other stoppages. Goals scored in periods of extra time or penalty shootouts do not count.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	For example, a prop for total number of goals for 3 English Premiere matches on a Sunday, must have all 3 matches completed for action on that day. If one or more games is not played (or completed) on that Sunday, the wager has no action.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>For proposition bets concerning home vs away goals on a specific day in a specific league/competition, the exact number of matches must be played on that day and wagers will be decided based on two halves of 45 minutes each and any time the referee adds to compensate for injuries and other stoppages.

Many tracks have carry over pools for the pick six that can grow to as high as a million dollars.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Quiniela or Reverse Forecast (UK).</strong>&nbsp;A bet placed on two horses to finish first and second in either order.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Perfecta or Exacta or Straight Forecast (UK).</strong>&nbsp;A bet placed on two horses but they must cross the finish line in exact chosen order.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Trifecta or Tricast or Treble Forecast (UK).</strong>&nbsp;A bet&nbsp;<strong>placed</strong>&nbsp;on three horses to cross the finish line in exact chosen order.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Superfecta.</strong>&nbsp;A bet placed on four horses to cross the finish line in exact chosen order.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Daily Double.</strong>&nbsp;Similar to an accumulator you select the winners of the first and second races on that day. You must place your bet before the start of the first race.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Jackpot.</strong>&nbsp;Pick six winners in six races to share in a Jackpot prize. The rules and prizes will vary from race track to race track.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Parlay or Accumulator.</strong>&nbsp;A multiple bet. A kind of &#39;let-it-ride&#39; bet. Making simultaneous selections on two or more races with the intent of pressing the winnings of the first win on the bet of the following race selected, and so on. All the selections made must win for you to win the parlay. If a race is a tie, postponed or cancelled, your parlay is automatically reduced by one selection; a double parlay becomes a straight bet, a triple parlay becomes a double. A parlay bet can yield huge dividends if won.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Future.</strong>&nbsp;A bet on a future event. At the start of each season, the sportsbooks give out odds for horses to win a certain event. The odds change as the race date approaches and in most cases get shorter, but if you win you get paid at the original odds that you took. This is possibly one of the most profitable bets if you have considerable knowledge of the race that you are betting on including the jockeys, and a good sense of judgement.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Exotic Bets.</strong>&nbsp;Betting on unusual events. Some sports books post odds and take bets on a wide variety of other sports related events and activities. A few others will take bets on just about anything you can think of.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Proposition Bet or Prop Bet.</strong>&nbsp;An offer of bets at odds and conditions chosen by the sportsbook, usually on &#39;Exotic&#39; bets.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', 3, '2014-4-18', 2, 1, '2014-4-18 11:37:57');
