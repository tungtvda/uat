Besides his reputation of being punctual, a quality that reportedly came from his time studying in Japan, he is the CEO of the country&rsquo;s second largest property development company by annual sales&ndash;Mah Sing Group Bhd&ndash;after all.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	As it turns out, he arrives slightly later than me, only because he was caught by the recent landslides in the city. When he arrives, he is brisk but personable and warm.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	After wrapping up what must be one of shortest photo shoots I&rsquo;ve experienced (as I said, he&rsquo;s quick) he sits down to say, first of all, that he is very bullish about the market.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	While many have been taking in the entire drama of the recent general elections, Leong has been on the move. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been very busy; you will see we are going to announce more and more land acquisitions over the coming months,&rdquo; says Leong in his raspy voice and straightforward manner.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Despite the fact that last year saw the property market&rsquo;s total number of transactions fall and value increase modestly by 4%, Mah Sing&rsquo;s own sales performance increased by about 11% to RM2.5bil, he proudly states. &ldquo;We actually beat the market.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The elections are now also over, bringing with them the suspense that came with it, and KLSE has reacted with a jump for joy. While not all stocks consistently rose, Mah Sing&rsquo;s has, and its current price at time of writing, RM2.80, is the highest achieved in the last year.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&ldquo;With general elections finally out of the way, investors will likely refocus on the fundamentals of the property sector,&rdquo; says a company report by CIMB Analyst which upgrades the sector from neutral to overweight (which in analyst-speak is of course positive, meaning that there is more fat to be gleaned from these stocks).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&ldquo;We believe that the removal of election overhang and continuity of government would aid buying sentiment,&rdquo; adds AmResearch&rsquo;s May market strategy report. &ldquo;Pre-sales momentum also would re-accelerate&hellip; Mah Sing is fast emerging as the entrepreneur-driven proxy to the robust property market.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&ldquo;I think after the general elections, most of the investors are coming back and playing catch up,&rdquo; is Leong&rsquo;s own take on things. &ldquo;A lot of people, especially foreigners, were waiting for the results of the elections.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	At the same time, the company&rsquo;s recent rights issue was oversubscribed, which provided the company more working capital for its projects and funds for the lands that Leong has been so busy shopping for.</p>\r\n', 1);
